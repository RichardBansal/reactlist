#reactlist

## Synopsis

Implementing <a href="https://nomadlist.com/" target="_blank">Nomadlistâ€™s</a> multi-filtering feature using Facebook's React front-end framework.

## Motivation

The motivation for this project is to learn a new library in a short time-span. This was during a 3-day personal hackathon.

I enjoyed the visual experience of searching through Nomadlist however found the responsiveness to be very slow. I wanted to implement the search and multi-filter features on the website using React to observe gains in responsiveness using a virtual DOM (react). All filters (+50) were not implemented, only a subset.

## Sample Demo
Click to view side-by-side comparison of the completed demo and original website. Use case is searching for 'Varna'.

## Code Structure

The repository is split into two folders: 

####_public_
This is where the website exists after compiling activities. Browserify was used to bundle all dependencies into a single app.js

####_js-build_
Post-compiled JSX (now JS).

####_js-src_
Pre-compiled JSX.
